## **Overview**
Our project is focused on building a pipeline for a household object locator. The pipeline will use our voice as input and process the object that we want to detect. Then we will use object localization and detection to search for the object in question using image feed from a camera. We will then use an LLM to process the outputs of the localization algorithm to help guide the user where to look. Currently, we have results for two sections. **Part 1** will be focused on the Object Localization and Detection module results and **Part 2** will be focused on our Speech to Text module. Finally, **Part 3** will explain what we have left to do and why we believe we will succeed in this project.
